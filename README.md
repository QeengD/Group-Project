# Group-Project
A thorough study of the provided Netflix movie dataset is produced by the "Analyzing Netflix Movie Data" initiative. The project offers information into movie lengths, trends in release years, and genre distribution through the completion of a set of activities. Effective communication of results is achieved through the use of visualizations like line plots and scatter plots. Additionally, the project places a focus on data analysis and coding abilities utilizing Python and well-known tools like pandas and matplotlib.

Obtain Nigeria's Economic data from the Worldbank. Download the data in an excel format (XIsx)

1. Clean your range and present the data in a Table.
• The data present in the table will be from the year 2001-2020
•It must contain the following indices;
• Population, female
• Imports of goods and services (current US$)
• Population, total
• GNI (current US$)
• Rural population
• Life expectancy at birth, total (years)
• Trade (% of GDP)
• Access to electricity (% of population)
• Gross national expenditure (current USS)
• Exports of goods and services (current USS)
• Rural population (% of total population)
• Fertility rate, total (births per woman)
•Access to electricity (% of population)
 Gross domestic savings (% of GDP)
• Population, male
• Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people)
• GDP (current USS)
• Urban population
• Air transport, freight (million ton-km)
• Surface area (sq. km)
• Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)
• Goods imports (BoP, current US$)

• The indices will be sorted alphabetically (A-Z)
• The Table should be named Economic_Analysis
• The color format for the table should be Green and White.
• Copy the Table to a new sheet and rename the sheet analysis
• Protect and set a password for the sheet
﻿The color format for the table should be Green and White.
﻿﻿Copy the Table to a new sheet and rename the sheet analysis
﻿Protect and set a password for the sheet
 
2. Create a Sheet in your workbook and name it Visualizations
The Color format for your charts will be the different shades of Green
﻿﻿Create a Tilendline Chart Showing GDP(Current Us$) and GNI(Current US $) by year . Column Chart showing Rural population, Urban Population and Population,total by year
﻿﻿Pie Chart Showing Fertility rate, total (births per woman) by Year
﻿﻿Scatterplot showing the relationship between Import of Goods (Current US $) and Export of Goods (Current US $)
﻿﻿Barchart showing Trade (% of GDP), Gross domestic savings (% of GDP), Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP) for the year 2011

3. Create a Power BI file of the Visualizations
